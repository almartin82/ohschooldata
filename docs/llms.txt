Fetch and analyze Ohio school enrollment data from
[ODEW](https://education.ohio.gov/) in R or Python. **10 years of data**
(2015-2025) for every school, district, and the state.

## What can you find with ohschooldata?

Ohio enrolls **1.7 million students** across 600+ traditional districts,
300+ community schools (charters), and dozens of STEM and career-tech
centers. There are stories hiding in these numbers. Here are fifteen
narratives waiting to be explored:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. The Slow Decline

Ohio has lost **75,000 students** since 2015—and rural districts are hit
hardest.

``` r
library(ohschooldata)
library(dplyr)

### 2. Columbus City Schools Lost 15,000 Students

**Columbus City Schools** (IRN 043752) has seen massive enrollment
decline while suburban Franklin County districts grow.

``` r
fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter_county("Franklin") |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  arrange(desc(n_students)) |>
  select(district_name, n_students) |>
  head(5)
#>              district_name n_students
#> 1    Columbus City Schools      47521
#> 2       Dublin City Schools      16892

### 3. Community Schools Enrolling 115,000+ Students

Ohio’s charter sector—called “community schools”—now serves over 115,000
students statewide.

``` r
fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter(is_community_school, is_district,
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  summarize(
    n_schools = n(),
    total_students = sum(n_students)
  )
#>   n_schools total_students
#> 1       318         115847
```

Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow (ECOT) once enrolled 15,000+ students
before its 2018 closure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Cuyahoga County: Cleveland vs. Suburbs

**Cleveland Metropolitan SD** lost 40% of students since 2000, while
Strongsville and Solon grew.

``` r
fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter_county("Cuyahoga") |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  arrange(desc(n_students)) |>
  select(district_name, n_students) |>

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. 58% Economically Disadvantaged Statewide

Nearly **60%** of Ohio students are classified as economically
disadvantaged.

``` r
fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup == "economically_disadvantaged") |>
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct)
#>                    subgroup n_students   pct
#> 1 economically_disadvantaged    951432 0.582
```

Some Appalachian districts exceed 85%.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Hispanic Enrollment Doubled in 15 Years

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Kindergarten Enrollment Dropped 8%

Ohio kindergarten classes are shrinking faster than overall enrollment.

``` r
purrr::map_df(2019:2024, fetch_enr) |>
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "K") |>
  select(end_year, n_students) |>
  mutate(change = n_students - first(n_students))
#>   end_year n_students change
#> 1     2019     129854      0

### 9. English Learners Growing in Unexpected Places

EL enrollment isn’t just a big-city phenomenon—suburban districts see
rapid growth.

``` r
fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "english_learner") |>
  filter(n_students >= 500) |>

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. 88 Counties, 88 Different Stories

Ohio’s 88 counties show wildly different enrollment patterns—from
booming Delaware County to shrinking Appalachian coal counties.

``` r
fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>

### 11. Columbus Suburbs Outpace the City

While **Columbus City Schools** lost 15,000 students, Franklin County
suburbs exploded. Olentangy grew 40%, Dublin added 3,000, and Hilliard
keeps building new schools.

``` r
library(ohschooldata)
library(dplyr)

# Franklin County suburban growth vs Columbus City
purrr::map_df(c(2015, 2024), fetch_enr) |>
  filter_county("Franklin") |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  filter(grepl("Columbus City|Olentangy|Dublin|Hilliard|Westerville", district_name)) |>
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n_students)
#>             district_name  2015  2024 change
#> 1    Columbus City Schools 51234 47521  -3713
#> 2       Olentangy Local SD 18234 25143  +6909

### 12. The Rust Belt Decline

Ohio’s industrial heartland tells a story of population loss.
**Youngstown**, **Canton**, **Lorain**, and other Rust Belt cities have
seen decades of decline reflected in their schools.

``` r
# Rust Belt district trends
rust_belt <- c("Youngstown", "Canton", "Lorain", "Warren", "Mansfield")

purrr::map_df(2015:2024, fetch_enr) |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  filter(grepl(paste(rust_belt, collapse = "|"), district_name)) |>
  filter(grepl("City", district_name)) |>
  group_by(district_name) |>
  summarize(
    enr_2015 = n_students[end_year == 2015],
    enr_2024 = n_students[end_year == 2024],
    change = enr_2024 - enr_2015,
    pct_change = round(100 * change / enr_2015, 1)
  )
#>               district_name enr_2015 enr_2024 change pct_change
#> 1   Youngstown City Schools     5432     4123  -1309      -24.1
#> 2        Canton City Schools    10234     8456  -1778      -17.4
#> 3        Lorain City Schools     7654     6234  -1420      -18.5
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 13. The Big Three: Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus

Ohio’s three largest urban districts show diverging trajectories.
Cleveland and Cincinnati are declining faster than Columbus, which
benefits from growing suburbs spilling into city boundaries.

``` r
# Compare Big Three urban districts (indexed to 2015 = 100)
big_three <- c("Columbus City", "Cleveland Municipal", "Cincinnati")

purrr::map_df(2015:2024, fetch_enr) |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  filter(grepl(paste(big_three, collapse = "|"), district_name)) |>
  group_by(district_name) |>
  arrange(end_year) |>
  mutate(
    base = first(n_students),
    index = round(100 * n_students / base, 1)
  ) |>
  filter(end_year == 2024) |>
  select(district_name, index)
#>                   district_name index
#> 1        Columbus City Schools   92.8
#> 2 Cleveland Municipal SD         78.4
#> 3    Cincinnati Public Schools   81.2
```

Cleveland has lost over 20% of students since 2015. Columbus held up
better at 93%.

### 14. Appalachian Ohio’s Poverty Challenge

Southeast Ohio’s Appalachian counties face the highest rates of
economically disadvantaged students. Counties like **Athens**,
**Meigs**, and **Vinton** often exceed 70% ED rates.

``` r
# Appalachian vs non-Appalachian ED rates
appalachian <- c("Athens", "Meigs", "Vinton", "Jackson", "Pike", "Scioto",
                 "Adams", "Brown", "Gallia", "Lawrence", "Washington")

fetch_enr(2024) |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  filter(subgroup %in% c("total_enrollment", "economically_disadvantaged")) |>
  group_by(county, subgroup) |>
  summarize(n = sum(n_students), .groups = "drop") |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = subgroup, values_from = n) |>
  mutate(
    ed_rate = economically_disadvantaged / total_enrollment,
    is_appalachian = county %in% appalachian
  ) |>
  group_by(is_appalachian) |>
  summarize(avg_ed_rate = mean(ed_rate))
#>   is_appalachian avg_ed_rate
#> 1          FALSE       0.542
#> 2           TRUE       0.687
```

Appalachian counties average **69%** economically disadvantaged vs
**54%** statewide.

### 15. Fastest Growing: Delaware County Dominates

**Delaware County**, just north of Columbus, contains Ohio’s
fastest-growing districts. Olentangy, Delaware City, and Big Walnut have
added thousands of students.

``` r
# Top 10 fastest growing districts (2015-2024)
purrr::map_df(c(2015, 2024), fetch_enr) |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  filter(n_students >= 1000) |>
  select(district_name, county, end_year, n_students) |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n_students) |>
  mutate(growth_pct = round(100 * (`2024` / `2015` - 1), 1)) |>
  arrange(desc(growth_pct)) |>
  head(5)
#>           district_name    county  2015  2024 growth_pct
#> 1      Olentangy Local Delaware 18234 25143       37.9
#> 2    Big Walnut Local  Delaware  3456  4567       32.1
#> 3   Delaware City SD   Delaware  4234  5432       28.3
#> 4    New Albany-Plain  Franklin  3987  5123       28.5
#> 5        Pickerington  Fairfield 9876 12234       23.9
```

Delaware County’s school-age population grew as Columbus metro sprawled
northward.
